## Hi, I'm Andrea!🐞

My goal is to help small mom-and-pop businesses, non-profits, and NGOs develop their websites and useful online tools.

💜 I'm passionate about environmental conservation & sustainable living, good design, Contra dance, local food, and my cats.

🌱 I'm excited to be learning more about development through OKCoders.
